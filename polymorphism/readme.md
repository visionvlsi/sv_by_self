#### Polymorphism theory

```

•Polymorphism provides an ability for an object to take on many form
•Method handle of parent class can be made to refer to the child method, this allows polymorphism or different forms of the same method
•OOPs Rule- Any extended class object can be assigned to base class but vice-versa is not possible .
•Virtual keyword is used in base class to override the method by child class.
•parent = child (Possible) -> Polymorphism
